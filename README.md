At the moment the only contents are the files in rulifson-1968 which were OCR'd and cleaned by Dyke Shaffer <dyke@enganon.com> from "A TREE META FOR THE XDS 940" by J. F. Rulifson, April 1968 [[http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/sri/arc/rulifson/A_Tree_Meta_For_The_XDS_940_Appendix_D_Apr68.pdf]].
